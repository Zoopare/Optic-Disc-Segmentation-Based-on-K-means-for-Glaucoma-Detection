# Optic-Disc-Segmentation-Based-on-K-means-for-Glaucoma-Detection
For the paper of course "Information Processing Technology on Internet of Things " and the title is "Optic Disc Segmentation Based on K-means for Glaucoma Detection"
There are three Python files in this respitory:
     1. Kmeans.py is for doing K-means algorithm.
     2. crop.py is for preprocessing the image to the certain size, that is (1000*1000)
     3. briandcontr.py is for adjusting the brightness and contrast.
